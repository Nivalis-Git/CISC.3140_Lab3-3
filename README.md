# Practice: Masking Text
This is a simple web application which will validate a password with an arbitrary input mask.


## Instructions (Linux)
To generate the data representation, GNU Make and xdg-utils must be installed.
```
sudo apt install xdg-utils
sudo apt install make
```

Move to the directory in which you placed the repository, and enter the command:
```
make
```
The system's default web browser will then open the application.
